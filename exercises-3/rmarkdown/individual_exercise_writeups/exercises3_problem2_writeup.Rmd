### Question 1

We can't simply run the regression of "crime" on "police" to estimate the effect of the number of police on the crime rate because the selection of policing level is endogenous. That is, governmental decision-makers can and do decide how much money to spend on policing in a locality based on its crime rate.

The ability to select the level of policing introduces selection bias that prevents a consistent estimate of the effect of policing on crime.

### Question 2

"How were the researchers from UPenn able to isolate this effect? Briefly describe their approach and discuss their result in the “Table 2” below, from the researchers' paper."

From the podcast transcript: 

> "We need to find an example where we get a lot of police for reasons unrelated to crime. Now, that you would think is a relatively rare occurrence. Why in the world would you create a lot of police if you didn't have a lot of crime? And they happened upon - and this is what great researchers do - the terrorism alert system. So you know all those colors, orange, red, whatever else they are. By law, because Washington, D.C., is likely to be a terrorism target, when the terror alert level goes to orange, then extra police are put on the Mall and other parts of Washington to protect against terrorists. It has nothing to do with street crime or things like that.
>  
> "So they could then ask, on orange alert days when there are extra police on the streets for reasons unrelated to street crime, what happens to street crime? Does it go down? And in fact, it does. It turns out that when you have the extra police there for terrorism-related reasons, they're on the streets, they make the streets safer, and things like murder, robbery, assault go down."

### Question 3

"Why did they have to control for Metro ridership? What was that trying to capture?"

> "You know, actually, in that vein, one of the things they considered was is it possible that tourists were less likely to visit Washington or to go out and about on...
>
> "So there are fewer victims, and you know what they did? They checked that hypothesis by looking at ridership levels on the Metro system, and they actually were not diminished on high-terror days, so they suggested the number of victims was largely unchanged."

### Question 4

"Below I am showing you "Table 4" from the researchers' paper. Just focus on the first column of the table. Can you describe the model being estimated here? What is the conclusion?"
